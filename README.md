# JavaScript and TypeScript parser for ðŸ¦€

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)](LICENSE.md)

The aim for this project is to build a JavaScript and TypeScript parser for Rust. The goal is to make the parser easy to integrate into applications such as web development tooling that require the speed of Rust.
To accomplish the goal, we aim to make the parser API simple and generate an abstract syntax tree (AST), which is easy to consume.

But to set your expectations right, this project is in its infancy, so not that many JavaScript or TypeScript programs parse yet.
However, if you found a bug or have an itch to scratch, please open an issue or send a pull request to improve the parser!

## Getting Started

```console
cargo run tests/declarations.js
```

```console
Script {
    body: BlockStatement {
        stmts: [
            VariableStatement(
                VariableStatement {
                    binding_identifier: Identifier {
                        value: "y",
                    },
                },
            ),
        ],
    },
}
```
